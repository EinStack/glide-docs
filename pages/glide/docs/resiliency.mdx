# Resiliency

Glide does fallbacks, provider heath tracking seamlessly for you.
Other than that, Glide exposes a various of configurations to let you control that resiliency functionality.

## Adaptive Health Tracking

TBU

## Fallbacks

Falling back is a part of [every routing strategy](/glide/docs/routers#routing-strategies) Glide provides.

<Important>
    In order to leverage automatic fallbacks you need to configure a router with a model pool with more than one model.
    It may be two and more different providers or the same provider deployed into a different regions (e.g. AWS and Azure).
</Important>

What model to fall back to in any specific case is defined by various factors like:
- health of each model in a pool (e.g. Glide is not going to fall back to models [considered as unhealthy](#adaptive-health-tracking))
- routing strategy (e.g. [priority](/glide/docs/routers#priority), [least latency](/glide/docs/routers#least-latency), etc.)

To minimize latency, Glide falls back right on the first model error to serve a given request with a healthy model as soon as possible.

### Retries

Finally, if the whole model pool is considered unhealthy, Glide resorts to retries with exponential backoff
optimistically trying to wait a bit to do its best to serve the request.

Retry configuration:
- `routers.language[].models[].retry.max_retries` (default: 3) - maximum number of retries
- `routers.language[].models[].retry.base_multiplier` (default: 2) - base multiplier for exponential backoff
- `routers.language[].models[].retry.min_delay` (default: 2s) - minimum delay between retries
- `routers.language[].models[].retry.max_delay` (default: 5s) - maximum delay between retries

Here is a sample retry configuration:

```yaml
routers:
  language:
    - id: default
      models:
        - id: openai
          retry:
            max_retries: 3
            base_multiplier: 2
            min_delay: "2s"
            max_delay: "5s"
          openai:
            api_key: "${env:OPENAI_API_KEY}"
```
