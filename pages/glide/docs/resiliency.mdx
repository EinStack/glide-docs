# Resiliency

Glide does fallbacks, provider heath tracking seamlessly for you.
Other than that, Glide exposes a various of configurations to let you control that resiliency functionality.

## Adaptive Health Tracking

Every time your models fail to serve a request, Glide tracks that and uses that information to make decisions about which model to use next.
If a model fails below a certain threshold in a period of time (known as the error budget),
Glide will consider that model unhealthy and will not use it to serve requests until its error budget recovers.

Here is a list of conditions that are considered as a failure:
- a model returns an error response (e.g. 5xx HTTP status code). This normally implies some temporary issues on the provide side.
- a model request is rate limited (e.g. 429 HTTP status code). Glide will mark the model as unhealthy for a specific time.
- a model request times out. This usually means the provider is overloaded or has a temporary issues.
- a model request fails with an authentication error (e.g. 401 HTTP status code). Glide will mark the model as unhealthy forever.
- a model returns no response (e.g. in case of OpenAI, the `choices` array is empty).

Health Tracking configuration (located on the model item level):
- `routers.language[].models[].error_budget` (default: "10/m") - the number of errors per second to tolerate before considering the model unhealthy. Supported time units: `ms`, `s`, `m` (minutes), `h`.
- `routers.language[].models[].client.timeout` (default: "10s") - the timeout for model requests

```yaml
routers:
  language:
    - id: default
      models:
        - id: openai
          error_budget: "10/m" # tolerate not more than 10 failures per minute
          client:
            timeout: "10s" # wait not longer than 10 seconds to receive a response from the model
          openai:
            api_key: "${env:OPENAI_API_KEY}"
```

## Fallbacks

Falling back is a part of [every routing strategy](/glide/docs/routers#routing-strategies) Glide provides.

<Important>
    In order to leverage automatic fallbacks you need to configure a router with a model pool with more than one model.
    It may be two and more different providers or the same provider deployed into a different regions (e.g. AWS and Azure).
</Important>

What model to fall back to in any specific case is defined by various factors like:
- health of each model in a pool (e.g. Glide is not going to fall back to models [considered as unhealthy](#adaptive-health-tracking))
- routing strategy (e.g. [priority](/glide/docs/routers#priority), [least latency](/glide/docs/routers#least-latency), etc.)

To minimize latency, Glide falls back right on the first model error to serve a given request with a healthy model as soon as possible.

### Retries

Finally, if the whole model pool is considered unhealthy, Glide resorts to retries with exponential backoff
optimistically trying to wait a bit to do its best to serve the request.

Retry configuration (located on the router level):
- `routers.language[].models[].retry.max_retries` (default: 3) - maximum number of retries
- `routers.language[].models[].retry.base_multiplier` (default: 2) - base multiplier for exponential backoff
- `routers.language[].models[].retry.min_delay` (default: 2s) - minimum delay between retries
- `routers.language[].models[].retry.max_delay` (default: 5s) - maximum delay between retries

Here is a sample retry configuration:

```yaml
routers:
  language:
    - id: default
      models:
        - id: openai
          retry:
            max_retries: 3
            base_multiplier: 2
            min_delay: "2s"
            max_delay: "5s"
          openai:
            api_key: "${env:OPENAI_API_KEY}"
```
