# Kubernetes Installation

EinStack provides you with [an official flexible Helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/einstack/glide) to install Glide into a Kubernetes cluster.

Before moving on, please make sure you have [Helm CLI](https://helm.sh/) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) installed locally.

<Steps>
### Add EinStack chart repository
        ```bash
        helm repo add einstack https://einstack.github.io/helm-charts
        helm repo update
        ```
### Create a Kubernetes Secret
        Before installing the Helm chart, you need to create a Kubernetes secret with your API keys like:

        ```bash
        kubectl create secret generic api-keys --from-literal=OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR OPENAI KEY>
        ```

        By default, Glide's chart comes with a configuration that contains [one language router]() with one OpenAI model that requires to put API key under the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Use the Secret
        Then, you need to create a custom `values.yaml` file to override the secret name like:
        ```yaml
        # save as custom.values.yaml, for example
        glide:
            apiKeySecret: "api-keys"
        ```
### Deploy Glide's chart ðŸš€
        Finally, you should be able to install Glide's chart via:

        ```yaml
        helm upgrade glide-gateway einstack/glide --values custom.values.yaml --install
        ```

        Please make sure your kubectl context is pointing to the right cluster and authenticated to do the deployment.
</Steps>

Once the deployment is done, you should be able to see a new `glide-gateway` deployment and corresponding pods in the namespace you used during the deployment.
