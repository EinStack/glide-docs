# Docker Installation

The easiest and quickest way to run Glide is via our [demo repository](https://github.com/EinStack/glide-demo.git) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

<Steps>
### Clone the Demo Repo

    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/EinStack/glide-demo.git
    ```

### Init Config

The demo repository comes with a basic config (learn more about [configurations]()). Additionally, you need to init your secrets by running:

        ```bash
        make init # from the demo root
        ```

This will create the `secrets` directory with one `.OPENAI_API_KEY` file that you need to put your key to.
Windows user should create the `secrets` directory and the corresponding `secrets/.OPENAI_API_KEY` file manually.

### Start Glide

After that, just use docker compose via this command to start your demo environment:

        ```bash
        make up
        ```

Windows users should simply run `docker-compose up -d`

### Sample API Request to `/chat` endpoint

        ```json
        {
            "message": {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Where was it played?"
            },
            "messageHistory": [
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
                {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."}
            ]
        }
        ```
See [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for more details.
