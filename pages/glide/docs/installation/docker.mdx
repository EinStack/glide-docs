# Docker Installation

The easiest and quickest way to run Glide is via our [examples repository](https://github.com/EinStack/glide-demo.git) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

<Steps>
### Clone the Demo Repo

    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/EinStack/glide-examples.git
    ```

### Init Config

The demo repository comes with a basic config (learn more about [configurations]()). Additionally, you need to init your secrets by running:

        ```bash
        make init # from the demo root
        ```

This will create the `secrets` directory with one `.OPENAI_API_KEY` file that you need to put your key to.
Windows user should create the `secrets` directory and the corresponding `secrets/.OPENAI_API_KEY` file manually.

### Start Glide

After that, just use docker compose via this command to start your demo environment:

        ```bash
        make up
        ```

Windows users should simply run `docker-compose up -d`

### Sample API Request to `/chat` endpoint

    URL: POST `http://127.0.0.1:9099/v1/language/default/chat`

    Payload:
    ```json
    {
        "message": {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Where was it played?"
        },
        "message_history": [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."}
        ]
    }
    ```

</Steps>
