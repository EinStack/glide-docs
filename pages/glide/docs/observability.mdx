# Observability

Telemetry configs defines logging, metrics (coming soon), and traces (coming soon) generated by Glide.

## Logging

Here are available parameters to define Glide's logging:

- `telemetry.logging.level` (default: `info`) - minimal log level to output. Possible values: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`
- `telemetry.logging.encoding` (default: `json`) - logging encoding. The `json` outputs structured logs useful for production setup while `console` is much more readable, so it fits development setups.
- `telemetry.logging.disable_caller` - controls adding information about place in Glide's codebase where the log was generated
- `telemetry.logging.disable_stacktrace` - controls adding information about full stacktrace to the code that generated logs
- `telemetry.logging.output_paths` (default: `[]` (an empty array)) - allows to save logging streams to the specified files
- `telemetry.logging.output_paths` (default: `{}` (an empty map)) - key-value pairs to label each Glide's log record.

A sample of the configuration:

```yaml
telemetry:
  logging:
    level: info # available values: debug, info, warning, error
    encoding: json # available values: console, json
    disable_caller: false
    disable_stacktrace: false
    output_paths: []
    initial_fields: {}

# everything else
# ...
```
