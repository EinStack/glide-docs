## üê¶ What is Glide?

Glide is a cloud-native [open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) LLM gateway, delivering high-performance LLMOps in one single binary.

The idea of Glide is to take away common functionality needed during communication with LLMs and building GenAI applications on a level of a separate service.
That way you don't have to put that pile of logic into your applications and just seamlessly utilize it via Glide.
So you can focus on building your core business logic and solve common concerns via configuring Glide.

<Important>
    Glide is currently under active development.
    Feel free to give us a star and watch in [Github](https://github.com/EinStack/glide) not to miss any updates.

        High performance and scalability are our priority, so Glide won't slow you down and scale out as you grow.

        Glide is designed around resiliency and failures, so your application can achieve **high availability** working with external models and **survive** the toughest real-world situations.

## Features

- **Unified API**: Change your model providers without a need to modify your applications
- **High Performance**: Written in [Golang](https://go.dev/) with the best practices of software development in a cloud-native environments in mind
- Flexible **routing** across several models and various strategies like [the least latency](/essentials/routers#least-latency-router), [weighted round-robin](http://localhost:3000/essentials/routers#weighted-round-robin-router), [round-robin](http://localhost:3000/essentials/routers#round-robin-router), [priority-based routing](/essentials/routers#priority-router). All strategies include **low-latency fallback mechanisms** to ensure resiliency
- Support [popular LLM providers](/essentials/providers)
- **Centralized** configuration and API key management
- **Production-ready Observability**: Always know what's going on with the heart of your system via logs, metrics, and traces. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is natively supported (coming soon).
- and [much more is coming](https://github.com/EinStack/glide/blob/develop/ROADMAP.md)
