## üê¶ What is Glide?

Glide is a lightweight blazing-fast cloud-native [open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) LLM gateway, delivering high-performance LLMOps in one single binary.
Glide provides a simplified way to build application resilience, reduce latency, and manage API keys among many other features.

<Important>
    Glide is currently under active development.
    Feel free to give us a star and watch in [Github](https://github.com/EinStack/glide) not to miss any updates.

        title="Resilient"
    >
        Glide is designed around resiliency and failures, so your application can achieve **high availability** working with external models and **survive** the toughest real-world situations.

## Features

- **Unified API**: Change your model providers without a need to modify your applications
- **High Performance**: Written in [Golang](https://go.dev/) with the best practices of software development in a cloud-native environments in mind
- Flexible **routing** across several models and various strategies like [the least latency](/essentials/routers#least-latency-router), [weighted round-robin](http://localhost:3000/essentials/routers#weighted-round-robin-router), [round-robin](http://localhost:3000/essentials/routers#round-robin-router), [priority-based routing](/essentials/routers#priority-router). All strategies include **low-latency fallback mechanisms** to ensure resiliency
- Support [Popular LLM providers](/essentials/providers)
- **Centralized** configuration and API key management
- **Production-ready Observability**: Always know what's going on with the heart of your system via logs, metrics, and traces. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is natively supported (coming soon).
- and [much more is coming](https://github.com/EinStack/glide/blob/develop/ROADMAP.md)
