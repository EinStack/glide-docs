## üê¶ What is Glide?

Glide is a cloud-native LLM gateway, delivering high-performance LLMOps in a lightweight package.
Glide provides a simplified way to build application resilience, reduce latency, and manage API keys among many other features.

## Install and Deploy üëá

#### Setup Config File

The initial phase in deploying Glide involves setting up your configuration file in the project root. For the basic setup, it is essential to have at least one pool with a minimum of one model. 
```yaml
routers:
  language:
    - id: my-chat-router
      strategy: priority
      models:
        - id: primary
          openai:
            api_key: "XXXXXXXXX"
```


#### Deployment

Currently the only supported deployment is via container.

#### Docker

1. **Install Git:**
   Ensure that Git is installed on your machine. You can download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and paste the code below:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EinStack/glide.git
   ```

3. **Build Docker Image:**

  Create a Dockerfile in the project root. Below is a sample.

    ```Dockerfile
    # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

  FROM golang:1.22rc1-alpine3.19

  # Set destination for COPY
  WORKDIR /app

  # Download Go modules
  COPY go.mod go.sum ./
  RUN go mod download

  # Copy the source code. Note the slash at the end, as explained in
  # https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy
  COPY . ./

  # Build
  RUN go build -o ./dist/glide

  # Update HostPort in pkg/api/http/config.go to 0.0.0.0:9099. Eventually this will be specified in the config file.
  EXPOSE 9099 

  # Run 
  # replace with the name of the config file in root
  CMD ["./dist/glide", "-c", "./config.yaml"] 
  ```
  
  Now that you have a Dockerfile, build the container.

    ```bash
    docker build -t <image_name> .
    ```

4. **Deploy:**
   Deploy the image to your prefered image hosting platform.
